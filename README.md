# USB-GATEWAY-
A cybersecurity project leveraging machine learning for real-time detection of malicious USB devices, ensuring endpoint security and data protection.


AI-Powered USB Threat Detection üîê  

Overview  
This project is designed to "Detect and prevent malicious USB devices" from compromising system security. Using machine learning-based anomaly detection, it monitors USB activity and flags suspicious behavior in real time.  

Features  
- USB Device Monitoring: Tracks all connected USB devices.  
- Anomaly Detection: Uses AI to classify legitimate vs. malicious USBs.  
- Automated Alerts: Sends security notifications when threats are detected.  
- Platform Compatibility: Works on Windows and Linux.  

üèó Technology Stack  
- Programming Language: Python  , jupter
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
- USB Monitoring: PyUSB, Udev (Linux), PyWin32 (Windows)  
- Data Logging: SQLite for storing USB activity logs
